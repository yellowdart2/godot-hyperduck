This is a project to recreate a flash game in Godot 4. It's called hyperduck 
for obvious reasons. 

# Things to fix

- There has to be an actual way to do for loops in Godot 4

- mp3 files crash on import - might have to try using the import tab in future tests

# Completed fixes

- ~~The platform spawning script still has the old code for connecting the player signal
to the limited player back when we were instantiating them there - need to move that 
code to wherever the new instatiating code ends up~~

- ~~The music loops weird, on top of being terrible in general~~

- ~~All of the art assets need to be resized bleh~~
